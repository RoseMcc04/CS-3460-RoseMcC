## Review

- **Hash tables** implement a dictionary/set, and support `find(k)`, `insert(k)`, and `remove(k)`
    - `insert(k)` and `remove(k)` take `O(1)` amortized time (due to *rebalancing*)
    - With *universal hashing*, `find(k)` takes `O(1)` expected time
- The previous methods focus on storing *integers*
- How do we store more complicated data types?
    - Typically, *pointers* to *objects*

## All Data Types are Arrays

- Any data type can be *serialized* (represented as a sequence of integers)
    - **Strings** are just sequences of ASCII values
    - **Files** are just sequences of bytes
    - **Multi-dimensional arrays** can be "flattened into one dimension"
    - **Images** are 2D arrays of RGB pixel values
    - **Audio** is an array of amplitudes sampled from an analog signal
    - **Video** is a container for images (frames), often with audio
- So, *how do we hash arrays?*

## Hashing Arrays

- How do we hash an *array* `A` to an *integer* in the range `[0 ... m-1]`?
- First idea:
    - `h(A[]) = (A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + ... + A[n-1]) mod m`
    - Very *structured* - Collisions will happen frequently among *"similar"* arrays

## Polynomial Hash Functions

- What is we instead think of `A[]` as the *coefficients of a polynomial*?
    - `h(A[]) = p(x) = (A[0] * x^(n-1) + A[1] * x^(n-2) + ... + A[n-2] * x + A[n-1]) mod m`
- To evaluate `h(A[])`, evaluate `p(x)` at a randomly chosen `x`
- How do we evaluate this *quickly*? **Horner's rule**
```java
int x = 17; // pre-decide a random x-value
int hash = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
{
    hash = (hash * x + A[i]) % m;
}
```

## Uses for Hashing

- **Consider:** By hashing a file down to a small integer *"fingerprint"*, we can:
    - *Compare* (approximately) two files extremely quickly
    - Compare files in different locations with *minimal communication*
    - Detect tampering in important files (i.e., *checksums*)
    - Ensure *integrity of file transfer* by sharing the checksum separately

## What About Collisions?

- Suppose we hash our object to a 128-bit integer using polynomial hashing
- What is the probability two *different* arrays `A[]` and `B[]` result in the same hash? What is the probability `h(A[]) == h(B[])`?
    - `pA(x) = A[0]x^(n-1) + A[1]x^(n-2) + ... + A[n-2]x + A[n-1]`
    - `pB(x) = B[0]x^(n-1) + B[1]x^(n-2) + ... + B[n-2]x + B[n-1]`
- We get a collision if we choose an `x` such that `pA(x) == pB(x)` mod `m`
- How many *unlucky* values of `x` can there be?
<br><br>

- *Two* lines (first-degree polynomials) can degree at most at *one* point
- `pA(x) = A[0]x + A[1]`
- `pB(x) = B[0]x + B[1]`
- Alternatively, two points uniquely describe a line

- *Two* quadratics (second-degree polynomials) can agree at most at *two* points
- `pA(x) = A[0]x^2 + A[1]x + A[2]`
- `pB(x) = B[0]x^2 + B[1]x + B[2]`
- Alternatively, three points uniquely describe a quadratic
- Generally two `(n-1)` degree polynomials can only agree in at most `(n-1)` points, *even if we do arithmetic modulo a prime*

## Collisions are Extremely Rare!

- We get a collision if we choose an `x` such that `pA(x) == pB(x)` mod `m`
- How many *unlucky* values of `x` can there be?
    - If `m` is prime, there are at most `n-1` values for x that will cause a collision
    - Given `m â‰ˆ 2^128`, the probability of choosing a bad `x` from `0...m-1` is `n/(2^128)`, which is `extremely small` even for large arrays
