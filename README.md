# CS 3460 (Data Structures)

*Data Structures is the study of organizing data in memory in order to access them efficiently. In this class, we study data structures for storing sets and sequences in the form of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, and binary search trees. We also learn the art of abstraction by treating these data structures as black boxes to solve more complex algorithms. Data structures are vital in almost every field of computer science, and we cover applications in text compression, security, parsing, and more. We learn to model certain problems as a graph, and study graph algorithms for traversing and computing shortest paths.
Prerequisite: C_S 2490 with a minimum grade of “C” (2.0).*
