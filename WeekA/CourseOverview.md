## Course Overview

- The goal of this course is to provide an *introduction to data structures and algorithms* in a *fun, fast-paced environment*
- Together, we will learn:
    - *Elementary data structures* (such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks)
    - *Fundamental algorithmic processes* (such as searching, selection, and sorting)
    - *Algorithmic analysis* (using tooks such as asymptotic notation, recurrence relations, and proof techniques)
    - Important data structures such as *hash tables, priority queues, and binary search trees*
    - *Useful graph algorithms* to traverse a graph and compute a shortest path
    - *Algorithm design techniques* using abstractions, and to *improve our practical coding skills*

## Why Study Data Structures?

- Data structures are at the core of *every part* of computing!
- *Operating systems, compiler design, programming languages, networking, databases, graphics, and more!*
- All of the easy problems are *solved*! Every field is making use of *data science* to solve their hard problems
- *Science, engineering, finance, arts and humanities, commerce, health and wellness*
- Learning to write *efficient* solutions is crucially important -- efficiency is everything!
- Developing proficiency with data structures and algorithm design are one of the key things that separate a *computer scientist* from a *programmer*
- Algorithms and data structures, above all else, are *fun*!
